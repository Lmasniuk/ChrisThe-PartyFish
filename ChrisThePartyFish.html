    <h1>Chris the Party Fish Game</h1>
    <p>Here is the landing page for the Chris the Party Fish javascript based web game.   <br>
    I finally decided to go back to making this game after trying about 10 different things. I initially was expecting way too much of myself and gave up the game idea,
    then decided making an android device live wallpaper was harder than I thought, then tried a couple more things before ending up with this game.<br>
    It wasn't fun for the first long while until I actually started coding for this game. <br>
    I created several original 40x40 pixel art images for the Fish as well as the seaweed, the border, the trophy, the stereo, and the dancefloor.
    Also, the song that plays after getting the boom box is the original Chris the Party Fish song that I made.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>First you have to get the music going to dance on the dance floor.</li> 
        <li>Then you have to get the bottle of bubbly so you can get out of the water.</li> 
        <li>Finally you have to get that good ole Unity Trophy.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>What's missing</h2>
    <p>
        I made the game in a frenzy of coding and made it up as I went along based off of my initial game idea that I had posted on Piazza and therefore don't have any mockups or diagrams other than what is inside my brain<br>
        The game is made from HTML, CSS and Javascript files. I did not use any cool Javascript libraries although I did search for some to use but got no where in attempting to do so.<br>
        I did what I could to make it so that it resembled the details of the proposed game on Piazza but mainly broke up big problems into smaller ones and had a fun learning experience to get each piece of the code puzzle working. <br>
        Also, there is some key features and ideas that are missing from the game that I would include if I were to continue with this project, these features and ideas are as follows
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mobile Friendly</li>
            <li>Each time a music item is collected a layer of the song is played</li>
            <li>More Levels</li>
            <li>Concept of health so that the player can lose the game</li>
            <li>More challenging</li>
            <li>Animation</li>
            <li>better art</li>
            <li>Much, much, more</li>
        </ul>
       <p> The game is very amateur and not very amusing as of right now but it was a great experience making it and there is quite
    a bit to it. It is obvious that much more would be done if I were to try finish and promote the game publicly or commercially  </p>
